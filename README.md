# Neural Nets

My personal attempt to learn more about neural nets and start using it for solutions.
Thanks [GK](https://medium.com/@gk_/how-neural-networks-work-ff4c7ad371f7), for the help.

That is not the best study in the world, but I'm trying my best.

## Installation

```
cd neural_nets
conda update conda
conda create --name neural_net python=3
source activate neural_net
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Running
```
jupyter notebook
```
